# Business-Merger


The company Facebike purchased company WhosApp and the HR employee system needs to be merged.  WhosApp will be allowed to operate as a standalone company however Facebike will be required to submit payroll for all the employees. FaceBike HR department should be able to search for employees in both HR employee systems and move employee information from WhosApp to Facebike.

The system we are implemented helps in searching the employee information in both systems, moving employee information from WhosApp to Facebike, editing the employee details and updating them to database.  It will increase productivity and reduce costs by using one system to manage both companies
